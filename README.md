## Dependencies 👇

Here's what each package does:

- **Faker.js**: Generates mock data for testing and demos.
- **Bcrypt & Bcryptjs**: Secures passwords by hashing them before storage.
- **Connect-flash**: Shows temporary messages like "You're logged in!" or "Error, try again."
- **Dotenv**: Manages environment variables, keeps API keys and secrets safe.
- **Express-session**: Manages user sessions (keeps you logged in and tracks your info).
- **Express**: Framework for building the backend of the app.
- **Jest**: Testing library to make sure everything is running smoothly.
- **Passport & Passport-local**: Manages user authentication.
- **pg-hstore & pg**: Handles PostgreSQL databases. pg-hstore is for the Hstore data type in PostgreSQL.
